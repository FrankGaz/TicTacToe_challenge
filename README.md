# TicTacToe_challenge
Tech Test for GeniusCrew
By Frank Artacho

----------------------------------

This is an React App

To run this App:

1 - Go to the folder "tictactoe-challenge" in your terminal.

2 - Use "npm install" to install all the dependencies.

3 - Use "npm start" or "yarn start" to run the app. 
    The app should be in your browser. If not, go to "http://localhost:3000/" in your browser.

NOTES:

- I've used the "classnames" utility from npm. https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames.

- I've installed SASS for the style sheets. https://sass-lang.com/

- Due to every component it's always visible, all the style sheets are imported in the main one "main.scss". Otherwise it's better to import each style sheet in each component.
